# Anouncement
Because Kiloo/Sybo now erncrypt all files in the SubwaySurfers app, it's harder to publish the files for the characters and boards-

For this Version I tried to find the right name for the characters and boards and write the json code directly in the old files instead of taking it directly out of the game folder

You can still download all files and put them in the right folder and it will work, SubwaySurfers makes it just easy enough and encrypts those files when they are in the folder, so there changes nothing in this

You can also use an old versions of the app, right now I found v2.39.0 best working and the files will not be encrypted, the downside there is that the SeasonHunt will say that you need to udate your app and you dont get new Characters 

Insight how I did it [test](todo/test)
