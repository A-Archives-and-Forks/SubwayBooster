### Info

The save files in SubwaySurf are now encrypted, which doesn't change the way how to modify the pre-generated files, like new Characters/Outfits/Boards.
By just replacing your encrypted SubwaySurf save files with the unencrypted modified ones, it will modify to the new Values.

### How do I use it?

To modify the SubwaySurfers files, you'll need a file explorer and the latest [release](https://github.com/HerrErde/SubwayBooster/releases/latest). \
Once you've downloaded the release, simply unpack the Zip file and extract its contents into the same folder (This process may vary depending on the file explorer you're using).
In the extracted files, you'll have the **Android** folder. Copy this folder to the **Internal Storage** (which has its own **Android** folder) of your Android device.
(You'll need to have full root access to your Android/data folder for this step).

Non root you can use [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app) follow the steps and use the app ZArchiver.

If you need help join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NAXbNwKK2V)

If you know how to, you can edit the individual files and then copy them into the `com.kiloo.subwaysurf` folder. \
Just make sure to know to understand which changes you're making.
